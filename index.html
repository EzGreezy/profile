			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Valentino Paksidena Griffith. I am a college student at Universitas Gadjah Mada. Currently majoring Software Engineering. Absolutely love to do creative works using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro. Likes to play fingerboard as a hobby, and finally going pro around 2016. Won my first championship that year at freestyle category, beating 5 another fingerboard freestyler. Have been practice programming using Python and Java languages. Since then, i've make many different algorithm for various necessities. Website making is another thing that i learn and absolutely love because of its simplicity. And this website was made as project to promote myself. Also love to play videogames, especially racing, adventure, and first-person shooter genre.
